            <h1>CSS Notes</h1>
            <p>
                CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a rule based language. 
                The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. 

                We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, 
                which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, 
                then a value that we'd like to give the property.
                
                Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. 
                CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified
                
                <h2>Getting started</h2>

                * There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document: using a link element (external style sheet), 
                    inside style tag (internal style sheet) and with style tag in html element (inline css declaration).
                
                * Targeting an element selector â€” this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name 
                
                * p,li {
                    color: red;
                }

                * The browser is adding some default styling to html elements to make it readable you can override that as well 
                    with your custom css, e.g. to remove default bullet points from list items, 
                    li {
                        list-style-type: bengali;
                    }
                    all html element that has display type of list-item can be targetted and their style can be changed as above. 
                
                * select a subset of element without changing the other element of same type; in such case use class attribute.
                    
                    <li class="special">Item special</li>

                    and style it by,
                    .special{
                        color: red;
                    } 
                    class selector starts with fullstp "."
                    any element whose class attribute is set to value "special" will take effect of the above css rule. 
                
                * Select element more specifically, 
                    li.special{
                        color: red;
                    }
                    target any li element that has a class of special, 
                    In this case any other element with class specials will be affected by above css rule.
                
                * It is sometimes best to bypass the element and refer to the class, unless you know that you want to create 
                    some special rules for one element alone, and perhaps want to make sure they are not applied to other things
                
                * Descendant combinator, which takes the form of a space " " between two other selectors.
                    li em {
                        color: rebeccapurple;
                    }
                    select the em element which is(/are) nested inside (Descendant of) li.

                * Adjacent sibling combinator, place a plus sign "+" between two selector, 
                    h1 + p {
                        font-weight: bold;
                    }
                    styles the first paragraph that comes directly after a top level heading h1. 
                
                * Styling based on state, 
                    a:link , a:hover, a:visited {
                        
                    }
                    link should always be underlined. 
                
                * Combining selector and combinator
                    /* selects any <span> that is inside a <p>, which is inside an <article>  */
                        article p span { ... }
                        
                    /* selects any <p> that comes directly after a <ul>, which comes directly after an <h1>  */
                    h1 + ul + p { ... }

                    /* You can combine multiple types together, too. Try adding the following into your code: */
                    body h1 + p .special {
                        color: yellow;
                        background-color: black;
                        padding: 5px;
                    }
                    
                    This will style any element with a class of special, which is inside a <p>, which comes just after an <h1>, 
                        which is inside a <body>.
                

                <h2> How CSS is structured </h2>
                    
                    * CSS resolves conflicting styling rules by two basic rule such as "The Cascading rule" and "The specificity rule"

                    * CSS styling rule that appear later in stylesheet replaces earlier conflicting styling rule;
                        this is called "The Cascading rule"
                    
                    * CSS styling rule with a class selector will replace styling rules that are applied only with element selectors. 
                        this is called "the specificity rule"
                    
                    * Basic structure, 

                        h1 {                                                                |selector   |
                            color: blue;            | css declaration |                                 | CSS Rulesets/Rules
                            font-weight: bold;      | css declaration | css declaration block           | e.g. h1 rule
                            background-color:white; | css declaration |                                 | 
                        }                                                                               |
                    
                    * Avoid using inline css and only when neccessary use internal if possible or inline othewise
                    
                    * The CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page.

                    * CSS properties and values are case-insensitive. The property and value in a property-value 
                        pair are separated by a colon (:).
                    
                    * If a property is unknown, or if a value is not valid for a given property, 
                        the declaration is processed as invalid. It is completely ignored by the browser's CSS engine.
                    
                    *  In CSS (and other web standards), it has been agreed that US spelling is the standard where there 
                        is language variation or uncertainty. For example, colour should be spelled color, as colour will not work.
                    
                    * functions such as "calc()" can be used as a value to "width" property; simple maths can be performed using it. 
                    
                    * "transform" property also takes other functions as value such as "rotate(0.8turn)"

                    * CSS @at-rules defines what CSS should perform and how it should behave. e.g, 
                        @include 'style2.css'

                        @media (max-width: 800px){
                            body{
                                background-color: blue;
                            }
                        }
                    
                    * Shorthand properties set several values at once. Properties such as font, background, padding, 
                        border, margin etc,
                    
                        In 4-value shorthands like padding and margin, the values are applied
                        in the order top, right, bottom, left (clockwise from the top). 

                        There are also other shorthand types, for example 2-value shorthands, which set padding/margin
                        for top/bottom, then left/right

                        - padding: 10px 15px 15px 5px;
                        is equivalent to these four lines of code:

                        padding-top: 10px;
                        padding-right: 15px;
                        padding-bottom: 15px;
                        padding-left: 5px;
                        
                        
                        - background: red url(bg-graphic.png) 10px 10px repeat-x fixed;
                        is equivalent to these five lines:

                        background-color: red;
                        background-image: url(bg-graphic.png);
                        background-position: 10px 10px;
                        background-repeat: repeat-x;
                        background-attachment: fixed;
                    
                    * A value not specified in CSS shorthand reverts to its initial value. This means an omission 
                        in CSS shorthand can override previously set values. Also any value that is invalid for a property 
                        in a shorthand will be passed on to the next property and skipped property's value will be resetted to 
                        their respective intial value.
                    
                    * /* CSS comments */

                    * White spaces in CSS is also ignored by the browser. 

                    * Though property values can be separated by space but there should not be any space between property name. 

                <h2>How CSS works</h2>

                    * How a page is rendered by the browser, 
                        1. Fetch the HTML.
                        2. Convert HTML to DOM.
                        3. Fetch all linked resources such as video, img, audio and CSS. Javascript is loaded later.
                        4. Parse CSS and sort them in different buckets based on their selector types. Figure out which
                            rules should be applied to which node in DOM and attaches style to them. (Render Tree)
                        5. The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules 
                            have been applied to it.
                        6. The visual display is showed on the screen.

                    * Browser just ignores CSS declaration that is not understood and move on to next declaration.

                    * Also if a selector is not valid in a list of selectors browser will just ignore the whole ruleset. 

                <h2>Cascade and Inheritance</h2>
                    
                    * Cascade: When two rules with same specificity are intend to apply to the same element then 
                        rule that comes later while parsing and interpretation will be effective overriding the other
                        that came earlier
                    
                    * Inheritance: Some element inherits specified value that is set to their parent's element and some do not. 

                    * Specificity: In a situation where two conflicting rules with different selectors that applies 
                        to the same element then the rule which has more specific selector will be effective.
                    
                    * Inline css > id selector > element selector > parent element selector

                    * Not Inherited properties: width, margin, padding, border; 
                    
                    * Inherited properties: 

                    * Controlling Inheritance
                        CSS provides four special universal property values for controlling inheritance. 
                        Every CSS property accepts these values.
                        
                        - Inherit: Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element. 
                            Effectively, this "turns on inheritance".
                        
                        - Initial: Sets the property value applied to a selected element to the initial value of that property.
                            The initial value of a CSS property is its default value, as listed in its definition table in the 
                            specification. 
                            
                            The usage of the initial value depends on whether a property is inherited or not:
                                For inherited properties, the initial value is used on the root element only, 
                                as long as no specified value is supplied.

                                For non-inherited properties, the initial value is used on all elements, 
                                as long as no specified value is supplied.

                            You can explicitly specify the initial value by using the initial keyword.
                            Note: The initial value should not be confused with the value specified by the browser's style sheet.

                        - Unset: Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property 
                            is naturally inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like initial.
                        
                        - Revert: Acts like unset in many cases, however will revert the property to the browser's default 
                            styling rather than the defaults applied to that property.
