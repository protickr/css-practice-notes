            <p>
                CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a rule based language. 
                The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. 

                We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, 
                which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, 
                then a value that we'd like to give the property.
                
                Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. 
                CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified
